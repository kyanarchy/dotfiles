# Conky

[Conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) is lightweight system monitor known for being high configurable. Conky can display anything from CPU consumption to network speed to the weather, either on the root desktop, the terminal, or its own window.

For more information on Conky's inbuilt variables and settings see the [Variable documentation](http://conky.sourceforge.net/variables.html) and the [Settings documentation](http://conky.sourceforge.net/config_settings.html), or check out [Casey's Conky Reference with Examples](http://www.ifxgroup.net/conky.htm).
